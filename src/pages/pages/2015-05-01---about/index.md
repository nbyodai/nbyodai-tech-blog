I started programming in 2014 after I jumped a logic test online with a company that promised to pay me to learn. That company, [Andela](andela.com), changed my life and gave me a new set of skills with which to rewrite my future. I have gone on to work for two funded startups and became the CTO of another.

There is so much out there regarding the possibility of solutions and also in the good that technology could do. This site is my attempt to add to that.

I love to work with Python and Javascript. A big fan of GraphQL and the sheer number of tools it has enabled. I think dogs are pretty awesome, hence the picture. I have a loving family.
