I started programming in 2014 after I jumped on a logic test online with a company that promised to pay me to learn. That company, [Andela](andela.com), changed my life and gave me a new set of skills with which to rewrite my future. I have gone on to work for two funded startups and became the CTO of another.

There is so much out there regarding the possibility of solutions and also in the good that technology could do. This site is my attempt to add to that.

I love to work with Python and Javascript. A big fan of GraphQL and the "Serverless" paradigm. I think dogs are awesome and the two that I own join with my brothers and sisters to make up a loving family.
